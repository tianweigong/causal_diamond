				<p>In this task, you will watch video clips and then try to figure out the connections between the components of several causal devices. The causal devices look like this:</p>
				<img id="figure_1" src="static/images/ins1.png">
				<p>Each device has two <b>control components</b> (buttons on the left) and one <b>target component</b> (diamond shaped on the right). </p>
			</div>

		<div id="ins_baserate">
			<div class="frame_big">
				<p><b>The target component</b> tends to activate fairly regularly. Each time it activates it lights up yellow for a short time. Watch this video to get some experience of how the target component behaves. </p>

			<div class="frame_big">
				<p>So, as you can see, it happens about once every five seconds all by itself.  However, <b>the control components</b> might affect this.</p>
				<p>Clicking on either control component might have an effect on the target component.</p>
				<p>There are three ways that a control component might influence the effect component.  It might <b>generate</b> an additional activation of the target.  It might <b>prevent</b> the next activation(s) of the target. Or it might have <b>no effect</b> on the target.</p>
				<p>Your task will be to figure out what kind of influence the two control components have on the target component for each device.</p>

			<div class="frame_big">
				<p> For each device, you will get to watch a video clip in which someone click on each control component several times.</p>
				<p>Your task is to identify the two connections from the control components to the target component. Each of these two connections can either be generative, preventative, or non-causal (no connection between the specific control component and target component).</p>
				<p>The total duration of a clip is <b>20 seconds</b>. At the beginning of a clip, the target component will self-activate. After 20 seconds it is not possible to observe further activations of any component even when it should activate.</p>
				<p>Each clip <b>can only be played once</b>. So please focus while watching the clip and try to understand the relationships between control components and target component. If you feel tired during the experiment, you can take a break between trials.</p>
				<p>You will get a <b>bonus</b> of 3 cents for each correctly identified connection per device. The maximum payment for completing the 19 devices is thus $1.14 (plus your basic payment of $1.00)</p>
				<p>You can respond by left clicking the grey area during or after each clip:</p>

				<p>You can always change your answers before you submit them. After submitting your answers, you will automatically be directed to the next trial.</p>
